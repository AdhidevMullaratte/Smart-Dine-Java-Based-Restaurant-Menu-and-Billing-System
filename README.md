# Smart-Dine-Java-Based-Restaurant-Menu-and-Billing-System


Welcome to Smart Dine, a project I built to simplify restaurant operations with Java and MySQL! This application is designed to manage menus, process customer orders, and generate bills in real-time, all while maintaining seamless integration with a MySQL database for data storage. Itâ€™s a complete solution for anyone looking to digitize restaurant workflows.
