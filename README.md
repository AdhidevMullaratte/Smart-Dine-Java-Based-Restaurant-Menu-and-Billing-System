# Smart-Dine-Java-Based-Restaurant-Menu-and-Billing-System
Your Restaurant Menu and Billing App is a robust Java-based application integrated with a MySQL database to manage restaurant operations efficiently. The app connects seamlessly with the MySQL backend, ensuring real-time data storage and retrieval for menu management, order processing, and billing.

Key Features:
1. Dynamic Menu Management:
Restaurant managers can add, edit, or delete menu items via the app.
Menu details (e.g., dish name, price, and category) are stored in a MySQL table for persistent data management.
2. Order Processing:
Customers or staff can select dishes from the menu to create an order.
Orders are dynamically stored in the MySQL database under an "orders" table with details like:
Order ID.
Items ordered.
Quantity.
Total price.
3. Billing System:
The app generates an itemized bill with details like:
Dish names.
Quantities.
Individual and total costs (with tax calculations).
Generated bills are saved in the database for future reference (e.g., under a "bills" table).
4. MySQL Integration:
The app uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with the MySQL database.
Tables like menu, orders, and bills are created and managed in MySQL to handle all app-related data.
5. User Interface:
Built using Java Swing or JavaFX for an intuitive and responsive GUI.
Options for:
Menu display and customization.
Order entry.
Bill generation.
6. Data Analytics (Optional Feature):
Generate reports from the database, such as:
Best-selling items.
Total revenue over time.
7. Error Handling:
Prevents issues like database connection failures or invalid user inputs with robust exception handling.
